### Lead Developer – Architect, FREELANCE

##### Frankfurt, Germany — 2021-Current

Worked for various customers as a lead developer / architect in Scrum teams. I mainly encourage and help the clients to apply the best practices available in order to ship to production with confidence and as often as possible. This includes:

A) Using the latest versions available of Java (e.g., 21) and Spring versions among other libraries in order to avoid future CVEs

B) Following the TDD principle in order to clarify the requirements since the beginning and avoid future bugs. This will also help with the cycle management upgrades and the code quality.

C) Design by contract (Contract Driven Development). By defining an agreement (e.g., OpenAPI, JSON Schema Registry, etc.) the consumers and producers know exactly the information which is going to be exchanged.
