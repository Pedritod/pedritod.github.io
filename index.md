# About

I have been working as a cloud developer / architect for consulting companies for the last nine years.
My duties have included all phases of development from the specification phase through the implementation and testing phases.
<br />
Ensuring code quality was also one of my responsibilities. In addition to development, I have also gained experience as a lead developer and architect in my last project. 
All the development I have been involved in, has followed the most recent programming methodologies like TDD and BDD and was driven using agile methodologies and tools
